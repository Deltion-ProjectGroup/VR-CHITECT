  - Now for the last feature for placement we have something called vert snapping.
  - Vert snapping is selecting a certain point of the object and making that point
    the center of the object..
  - A great example is when you want to put two nightstands next to eachother. Normally
    this would take alot of time and precision..
  - But when vertsnapping you can simply set the corner of the paw from the stand
    as center and point it at the corner of the paw from the other nightstand.
  - This will put them exactly next to eachother without having to spend ages on trying
    to reach the same effect.
  - Vertsnapping can take some time to master though so don't worry if it doesn't
    go right for the first few times.
  - To use vertsnapping hold the trigger on your left controller. A dot will appear
    this is the vert it will select as center point when you press the trigger on
    your right controller.
  - Once you have gotten your object in placement mode you can point with the pointer
    to another point of an object and it will try to put the centerpoint at that position.
  - If you don't want to use vert snapping after being in placement mode you can simple
    let go of the trigger of the left controller, this will reset the center point.
